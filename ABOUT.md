# About the Game Development

## A Unique Partnership

This game is the result of a unique collaboration between a passionate software engineer and OpenAI's ChatGPT. Throughout the development, we faced challenges and overcame obstacles by applying programming techniques and the combined creativity of human and AI.

## Challenges Faced

- **Interactivity**: We developed a system that captures user interaction in an intuitive way.
- **Game Logic**: Implementing complex rules for moving blocks between stacks required meticulous attention to detail.
- **Iterative Design**: The game evolved based on real-time feedback, allowing for quick adjustments and continuous improvements.

## Time and Dedication

The development spanned several interactive sessions, each building upon the work of the last. This dedication allowed a simple concept to transform into an engaging and challenging game.

## Problem-Solving

We encountered and fixed several bugs, which was crucial for ensuring a smooth and enjoyable user experience. Problem-solving was a constant part of the process, requiring careful analysis and creative solutions.

## Technology and Innovation

Artificial intelligence, represented here by ChatGPT, proved to be an invaluable tool, bringing efficiency and innovation to the game development process.

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to the software engineer for trusting ChatGPT to assist in developing this game. Together, we turned an idea into a playable reality that we hope will bring joy and challenge to many.
