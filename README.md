## Features

- Intuitive gameplay mechanics that are easy to learn but hard to master.
- Clean and colorful graphics for an enjoyable visual experience.
- Increasing difficulty with each level to keep you engaged and challenged.

## Installation

Ensure Python 3.6 or later is installed on your system. Follow these steps to get started:

## Objective
The goal of the game is to sort the squares into stacks by color. Each stack must contain squares of only one color, and all stacks must be complete to win the level.

## How to Play
- Click on a square to move it to another stack with available space.
- A stack can contain a maximum number of squares as defined for the current level.
- To complete a level, all stacks must contain squares of the same color.
- Upon completing a level, the number of squares per stack increases, and the game reshuffles the colors for the next level.
- The game ends when you reach a level that has more squares per stack than the number of available colors.

## Controls
- **Left Mouse Click**: Use the mouse to click and move the squares between the stacks.
- **Mouse Hover**: The mouse cursor highlights the squares when hovering over them.

## Difficulty Levels
- The game starts with 3 squares per stack.
- With each completed level, the number of squares per stack increases by one.
- The maximum number of squares per stack is limited by the number of available colors.

Good luck and have fun organizing the stacks!
